        <h2>
          1- What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The first aspect that caught my attention was the aesthetic of the page, which resembled a collage. The way it used a cutout shape of a person sweeping, combined with the checkered template usually associated with transparency or "no background," immediately stood out. This design choice seemed to suggest the invisibility of the janitor—a person who plays a crucial role but often goes unnoticed. This metaphor of invisibility, coupled with the interactive nature of the elements on the page, effectively communicated the significance of the janitor and set the tone for the entire experience.

        <h2>
          2- Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          During my time with the interactive experience, I found myself first scrolling through the page quickly to get an overall sense of its layout. I then re-scrolled, paying closer attention to the animations and movements of various elements. As I explored further, I instinctively clicked on the moving parts of the website, driven by the knowledge that this was an interactive experience. I discovered that only three parts of the website were interactive: the hearts that responded to clicks, the bin at the end that could be opened and closed, and the spread-out hearts that could be made to disappear. My actions alternated between scrolling, clicking, and testing different elements to uncover any additional interactions.

          3- What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          Given that the website did not offer an abundance of interactive material, I spent most of my time scrolling through the page and occasionally clicking around to see if I had missed any interactive features. The dynamic nature of the scrolling kept me engaged for a while, as I tried to understand the purpose behind each animated movement. However, as the interactivity was limited, my engagement was primarily focused on exploring the page layout and re-scrolling to observe how the animations reacted to different scrolling speeds.

        <h2>4- What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The most frequent actions during my interaction were scrolling and unscrolling to observe the animations and clicking on various parts of the page to explore their interactivity. I found myself repeatedly adjusting my scrolling speed to see how the page elements would move differently, and I also kept clicking on the hearts and the bin, hoping to uncover any hidden interactions or features. This combination of scrolling and clicking constituted the majority of my interaction within the two-minute period.

        <h2>5- What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The primary goal of this interactive experience appears to be raising awareness about the often-overlooked roles of janitors. By using visually engaging elements and limited interactivity, the website draws the user’s attention to the significance of janitors and encourages them to reflect on their typically unrecognized contributions. The design and interactivity serve to captivate the user long enough to convey the message effectively. The aesthetic choices, such as the cutout of the janitor against a transparent background, emphasize the invisibility and lack of acknowledgment that janitors often face.

        <h2>6- How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The interactive experience communicates its primary goal by engaging users with a blend of subtle interactivity and meaningful visuals. The choice to animate certain elements and allow users to interact with them—albeit minimally—keeps the user engaged just enough to ensure the message is received. The simplicity of the interactions, combined with the metaphorical use of visuals like the cutout janitor, helps to convey the idea that janitors, though essential, often go unnoticed in everyday life. The overall design creates an environment where the user is subtly guided to consider the importance of those who work behind the scenes.</p>

        <h2>7- What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The interactive experience seems designed to be a one-time engagement rather than something users would return to repeatedly. Initially, the movement and animations are captivating, and the limited interactive elements can hold the user’s attention for a short period. However, once these interactions are explored, there isn’t much reason to revisit the website. The experience feels like it is meant to create a singular, impactful moment of awareness rather than an ongoing engagement. After the first interaction, the repetition of the movements and the limited interactivity may lead to diminishing returns in terms of user interest.

        <h2>8- How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The experience communicates its intended interaction through the linear nature of its design. As users scroll through the page, they are guided by the animations and the few interactive elements that appear. The absence of deeper layers of interaction or new content beyond the initial exploration suggests that the website is intended for brief, focused engagement. The information presented and the movements of the visuals lead the user to the intended conclusion without encouraging prolonged or repeated visits. This design choice reinforces the idea that the experience is meant to make a quick, yet lasting, impression.

        <h2>9- What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The experience references the aesthetic of collage art, which combines various visual elements to create a cohesive message. It also nods to traditional forms of protest art or visual activism, where simple, impactful visuals are used to communicate social messages. Additionally, the website’s use of interactive elements resembles modern web design practices often found in digital storytelling platforms, where users are encouraged to engage with the content actively rather than passively. The blend of these references helps to create a dynamic experience that feels both artistic and socially conscious.

        <h2>10- What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          These references suggest that when engaging with the research experience, one should be observant and reflective. The collage-like presentation and the interactive elements imply that the user is expected to piece together the narrative and meaning from the various visual and interactive cues. It encourages an active role in interpreting the content rather than simply consuming information passively. This approach to interaction aligns with the idea of research as a process of discovery, where users are guided to uncover deeper meanings through engagement with the material.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>11- What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The references communicate a sense of introspection and awareness. The use of visual metaphors, such as the invisibility of the janitor, suggests that the user should feel a sense of empathy and recognition for those who are often overlooked. The artistic presentation and the purposeful limitation of interactivity evoke a feeling of contemplation, encouraging the user to think critically about the message being conveyed. Overall, the experience is designed to make the user feel thoughtful and perhaps even a bit unsettled by the realization of how often certain roles are undervalued in society.

        <h2>12- What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The most frustrating aspect of the interaction is the limited interactivity. After initially exploring the page, I was eager to discover more hidden features or layers of interaction. However, finding that only a few elements were interactive, and that these interactions were quite basic, left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed. The potential for a more engaging experience seemed present, but the limited scope of interactivity made the website feel somewhat repetitive and lacking in depth. This lack of engagement opportunities led to a feeling of frustration as I wanted more from the experience than it ultimately delivered.

        <h2>13- What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
        <p class="hind-regular">
          The most satisfying part of the interaction was the initial discovery of the website’s aesthetic and the metaphorical use of visuals. The realization that the cutout of the janitor with a transparent background was a deliberate design choice to highlight invisibility was particularly impactful. This clever use of imagery to convey a deeper message felt rewarding and demonstrated the thoughtfulness behind the design. The initial scrolling and the movements of the elements also provided a sense of satisfaction as they were visually pleasing and served to draw the user into the experience. This initial engagement was the highlight of the interaction, making the overall experience feel meaningful, even if brief.
